# Temp_portfolio
Temporary, un-finsihed portfolio.

As of now this repository contains only projects I worked on (by my self, any referance to "we" or "us" in these reports is solely a product of the habit of never writing "I" in a scientific report, a convention I'm not particularly good at upholding) in a course named FYS-STK3155 (Applied data analysis and machine learning https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/fys/FYS-STK3155/) at the Univeristy of Oslo.

The purpose of this directory is to give a small insight into some of the most basic (and not so basic) machine learning algorithms, as well as documenting my understanding of them. And also (perhaps) my own progression during the term i took this course.

This repo contains (in it's main directory) three folders. Each folder includes (at least) a pdf and a Jupyter notebook. There might be some loading issues with the notebooks (in regards to equations in particular), depending on your browser.

The folder project_1 details (an outline of) the derivation of the ordinary least squares method, and introduces (and motivates) regularization.
In this project I also derive the "formula" for the bias variance trade-off. All of this is used to model a mathematical function - called The Franke function - using linear regression.

The folder project_2 contains a notebook whose main goal is to present a (basic) feed forward neural network, (I've) written to do both regression and classification.
In this notebook we also take a look at mini-batch gradient descent.

The folder project_3 contains a notebook mainly focused on presenting, and comparing, a variety of different machine learning algorithms: linear regression, feed forward neural network (from project_2), and regression tree(s); random forest, bagging, and boosting. 
This folder also contains the code used to produce the results in a separate folder, due to the relatively large size of the project.
All of this comparison is done on the dataset Wold Happiness Report 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv), where I used the available data to attempt to predict the happiness is a country/ region based on some features.
